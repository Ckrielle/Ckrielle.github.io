<p>One of the best things you can do for your life right now is to just throw or preferably sell your phone to get rid of it (or give it for free if you're feeling generous). I am stating this of course because through thinking, listening, observing and experiencing I can safely say that smartphones are not worth having and using on a daily basis. Of course that isn't to say that they are worthless, as they have some uses.

First of they're budget portable cameras. That isn't to say that you buy a phone just for its' camera, but it's a feature which I've sorta come to appreciate. They are also quite remarkable pieces of technology which can offer an interesting range of applications. And last but not least, you can sell them. It still means minimizing loses (that is if you bought it) but hey it's something. Oh and they can also be used for social signaling. Ok that's all time to destroy them.

First of when I use the word phone I mean smartphone. Phones in the last decade sense are good devices and what I recommend people should have instead. Also as I wil be illustrating my points there will be times when some arguments fit and enhance one another, as they are connected. However I intend to write this article in a linear fashion rather than a programming stack, so it is what it is. Also guess what, this is my opinion. If you dislike it then I would appreciate it if you could offer a rebutal or logically disassemble my arguments. And if you like then hey good for you.

My main grip with them is that they are fundamentaly consoooooooming devices with low productive capabilities. That isn't to say that I value that which can only increase my productivity or that consuming is bad, on the contrary, consuming is essential as it provides exterior stimuli which can lead to either a better understanding of things or a creation of something new. What we can say however is that there is good consumption and bad consumption, and the consumption provided by phones is bad and meaningless both in what it offers and how it offers it. Let's start with the former. Human-Phone interaction is accomplished through apps, essentially websites and programs condensed into one service. The thing is that probably all of them are useless. What apps are boils down to games, social media and apps that enhance ones daily life. Now admittedly my gaming days are long gone as I don't find any appeal in them, however what is certain is that the games you find on phones are inferior time-wasters without substance. Instead of providing an engaging narattive or interesting gameplay, they are tidious, uninspired, meant to drain your bank account and provide no benefits other than a small dopamine rush. Life enhancing apps can be boiled down to diaries, educational, fitness and e-commerce apps, all of which are useless. You don't need a phone to have a diary and keep track of notes and dates, education apps suck just go and read a proper book on the subject. Fitness apps can be useful, however they are bloated with features you won't ever use unless you are serious about exercising. Measuring kilometers can be good and an indication of your advance though. Still, just one good feature on one type of app.

Now I know that I mentioned social medias in my previous argument along with how apps are presented to users on phones. However I consider them such pivotal parts of smartphones that they deserve their own category. In truth social media deserve an article onto themselves but for now let's keep them in the context of smartphones and in the general way phones prsent information. I was with an old professor of mine some weeks ago and we struck a conversation. In it, he mentioned different people he had lost contact with, and how Facebook had helped him find them. This is the only reason why social media should have existed. As
