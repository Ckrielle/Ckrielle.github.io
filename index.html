		<h2>I Am Machina.</h2>
		<p>I'm an Information Security Engineer and an Undergraduate student at nowhere for now. I try to work on many different aspects of security like binary overflows, bug bounties and partake in 
		CTF's. I also like programming with some projects in development.</p>
		<p>This page works as my personal small fish in the vast ocean of the internet. A small whoami so to say. It also provides links to my pressence of different platforms, as well as different links
		that refer you to my personal technical, literarily, and anything else, recommendations and opinions</p>
		</div>

		<div class="even">
		<img src="pics/hackerman.jpeg" alt="Hackerman">
		<h2>I Try To Become A Hacker.</h2>
		<p>I consider it the best profession there is. Whether you are a pentester, bug hunter, malware analyst or security architect the core values of hacking are, as the youngsters say, pretty based. 
		Above all it preaches understanding of concepts both on theoretical and practical levels, something extremely necessary if one wants to be a creator rather than another cog. However hacking
		doesn't create, it breaks. It exposes the logical fallacies of technological concepts and their executions that as a result are harmful to different groups, such as companies or the public.
		</p>
		<p>inb4 You might say that I'm not in a position to spout about hacker ideas when I'm still a toddler in the field. However even the opinion of a brainlet can be insightful. 
		<a href="hakcer.html">Here</a> is what I believe takes to become a hacker. Now that I've also added an RSS feed it will be easier to make writeups for such things.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="odd">
		<img src="pics/linux.webp" alt="Linux">
		<h2>Just Take The Linux Pill.</h2>
		<p>I consider Linux the definitive experience for using computers. I also believe there is no excuse for not using them. Whether it be programming, customization, servers, efficiency, feeling of 
		superiority, or technological freedom Linux does a much better job than MacOS or Windows. And for all you gamer boys and gals I've heard that gaming on Linux is improving exponentially, so why not 		    try it out?</p>
		<p>I currently run Manjaro i3 on my desktop and Arch with dwm on my Thinkpad X230. Maybe I'll add my config files on github and the programs I use.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="even">
		<img src="pics/latina.jpg" alt="LARBS">
		<h2>I Am Currently Learning Latin.</h2>
		<p>What can I say, Luke Smith and my admiration for the Roman Republic+Empire sucked me into them. Best case not only will I be reading old Latin texts that hold valuable knowledge, but		            will also be in a much better position to learn Romanji languages. Worst case I will drop them and have some general knowledge on them.  </p>
		<p>If you want to have a go yourself, follow this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PB5HPz2wBDgqWXPnn5ONgZicOPv8P7LbODvkCxjpI3w/edit">link</a> for a comprehensive guide.
		It is based on LLPSI, a book written exclusively in Latin which uses the concept of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_EQDtpYSNM&t=213s">comprehensive input</a> to teach you.

		<div class="odd">
		<img src="pics/homo.jpeg" alt="Homo Universalis">
		<h2>Homo Universalis Is Pretty Based IMHO.</h2>
		<p>Researchful, analytical, genuine curiosity and interest in every aspect of human study.</p>
		<p>I am in no way close to that, however it is an ideal I'm working towards. Even though the current competitive capitalistic system forces career specialisation, I consider it important
		for everyone to go beyond that and work on different topics. I believe that we become, rather than born, humans and that to an extent is achieved through exposing ourselves to different aspects
		of humanity. Otherwise we become robots. Succesful on what we do, but devoid of substance.
		</p>
		<p>This is my <a href="library.html">library</a>. I would be honored if you consulted it.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="even">
		<img src="pics/usogui.jpg" alt="Read Manga">
		<h2>I Like Mangas.</h2>
		<p>Anime might be a mistake, but that's not the case for manga. Even though it is a media that you have to get used to, I consider it extremely expressful with great inherent strengths.
		In my <a href="library.html">library</a> you can find my recommendations. The one I'm currently reading is called Usogui (and is on it's way to become my number 1).</p>
		<p>I also have ideas of my own but I suck at drawing, so if you are an artist why not try me?</p>
		</div>

		<div class="odd">
		<img src="pics/rss.jpg" alt="I googled RSS and it showed me this.">
		<h2>Get Updates On Me.</h2>
		<p>I have succesfully created an RSS feed. By adding https://Ckrielle.github.io/rss.xml to your RSS reader or by going to my <a href="blogindex.html">blogindex</a> you can keep up with personal 
		and professional developments of mine. You can follow me on Twitter to keep up with as well though to a lesser extent as I have it mostly to have a platform to propel myself and prefer RSS.</p>
