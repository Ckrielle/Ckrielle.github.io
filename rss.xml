<h2>If this doesn't come out good sorry but it's the first post</h2>
<p>
Holy mother of based what a chapter. Not gonna lie I didn't know what would happen, on one hand Usogui was being pounded in the face for the last 10 chapters so Toshio
certainly made you feel as if the Perfect Leader had managed to destroy the gambler and convey that it was the end, something which he admittedly try to do a bit too hard 
in the last chapter. But of course I couldn't stop thinking that it's our boy, the man with the asspull, he couldn't possibly go out without one last bang, without tasting one last tasteful plum. After all people on both the 4chan threads and the mangadex comments had already speculated on the clock playing an important role. Alas it did in the form of the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second">leap second</a>. Here is a tldr from a 4chan poster:
</p>

<i>Baku is the one who made the coincidence happen. When a leap second occurs during a year it takes place at a specific time, either June 31 or December 31 at 23:59:60 GMT/UTC time. Baku was apparently aware there is a leap second during that particular year in December. Japan's time zone is GMT+9 so it would occur during the 1th of January at 9:00AM. In other words if Baku beat Lalo on December 31th and immediately challenged Hal on the morning of the next day then he had a good chance to make the gamble coincide during a leap second. The idea could have been scrapped if he was forced to gamble in a significantly different time zone but luckily for him Protoporos is close to Japan(GMT+6).
</i>

<p>
Now of course there is the possibility that this is not the case, maybe just like Hal had predicted that the referrees would decrease the volume to hear better on the gamble which allowed him to use his echolocation, so could Baku have predicted that his constant trip to pound town would demoralise Kaji, thus making him and Marco walk outside to relax, which in turn somehow affected the clock. However I do not believe that. I we were to go back to chapter 326 (yes I checked it up), on the meeting which decide the details of the BAN, Baku pulled the Time card and this is the page
</p>

<p>
At that exact moment, considering that the day then was 7/12, Baku thought of the possibility of the leap second. The fact that for him time was important can be shown be these pages in chapter 327
</p>

<p>
He thought about the one month and then looked at Hachina, because in his mind he had already defeated Lalo and was stocking up possible tricks to use in StL. Now of course there is one other thought that has circulated and it's that Usogui knew about Leaders memory lapses, knew that one had happened recently and looked at him because he had predicted it would happen on the same day as StL. This could be considered another trick, however it has been speculated that Baku did that so he can get his friend back and show him the thrill of gambling, as was shown in the previous chapter (523). However I don't know how many information Baku had to be able to deduct as much, but if he thought about it with his limited knowledge then it was one hell of a gamble (let's call it that instead of an asspull).
</p>

<p>
At any case, oh my god the chapter, of course the art was top tier as alway. From the euphoric face of Yakou and the little smirk of Hal when he thought Baku had given up, to the flabbergasted face of Yakou, the complete disbilief of Hal, and of course the best all acording to keikaku face I've seen. Move aside FREEDOM, I've got my new favourite spread right here. 
</p>

<p>
If we were to believe that both the second leap and the memory lapse were inside Bakuss' predictions, then that means that in a short time he had found the perfect weapon to defeat Leader, organised the BAN agaisnt Lalo so that it would coincide with it and executed it perfectly by making Lalo become Kaise on the 23rd, and finally played StL so that not only could he meet Hal again, but so that each and every move he did brought him to the exact moment where he could pull the rug off of Hals feet and potentially win. But of course this is just speculation and we'll have to wait for two weeks to find out what's on his mind. And of course see the reactions of everybody.
